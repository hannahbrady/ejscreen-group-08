```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Read in data

```{r}
ces3demo <- read_csv(here("data","ces3demographics.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()
```


```{r}
ces3demo %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_hex(aes(x = white_percent, y = ces_3_0_score))+
  labs(x = "% white (of population)", y = "CES 3.0 score",
       title = "Relationship between cumulative pollution burden and white populations") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "navy", high = "orange") +
  theme_minimal()
```


From the hexplot we can see that the overall trend reveals that there is a negative correlation between the percent of the community identifying white as the cumuluative pollution burden.
